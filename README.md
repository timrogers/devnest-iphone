Devnest.app
============

What is DevNest?
-----------------

Twitter Developer Nest, known generally as DevNest, is a developer event for users of the Twitter API in London, United 
Kingdom. It is hosted every month at the offices of the world famous newspaper, The Guardian.

This application is designed in order to give the community a way to stay up to date with the events. It includes by 
default information like:

- the time, date and location of the next event.
- discussion on Twitter about the events using the hashtag #devnest
- tweets from the official DevNest account, @devnest
- the agenda of the next event

What resources are used in this project?
----------------------------------------

This project would not be possible without two important open source applications, both available on GitHub:

- [jQTouch](http://github.com/senchalabs/jQTouch) - this is used to create the iPhone style interface that is so 
familiar to developers today. jQTouch is a really great project and I would encourage everyone to use it. It's brilliant 
whether you want to create web applications or even native applications using...
- [PhoneGap](http://github.com/sintaxi/phonegap) - this is used to convert the web application into a native iPhone 
application to be submitted to the App Store. This is a truly amazing open source project and I thoroughly recommend it 
for anyone who wants to make iPhone apps. It is also compatible with other platforms like Palm WebOS, Blackberry and 
Android. A version of the project for Android is also available on GitHub [here](http://github.com/timrogers/devnest-android).
What should I do with this?
---------------------------

I'd love to see people remixing this project to make their own similar iPhone applications, or even improving my effort 
here. I would wholeheartedly welcome people improve the DevNest project, as this app is by no means perfect. I just 
wanted to make something and then get it out to the online community to enjoy.

I'd also quite like to see versions of the app for other platforms on which it is not currently available, like WebOS, Blackberry and Symbian. Please feel free to take the HTML assets and compile them with PhoneGap to these platforms and just upload them to the relevant stores!

With special thanks to [Multizone Ltd](http://www.multizone.co.uk) and Angus Fox for organising the event and for 
providing the iPhone developer account on which this app will hopefully eventually be released, once it is approved.
